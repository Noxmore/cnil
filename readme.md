# NIL: Noxmore's Incredible Library

This is attempting to be my extension of the standard library, containing things I think should be in by default, as well as a few extras.

NIL requires C23, and is intended to stay at the latest C standard.

> WARNING: This library uses advanced features only provided by GCC/Clang, mainly for reflection. MSVC is (at least currently) not supported.

> WARNING: Currently in heavy experimentation, not ready for real use. If you do use, expect many breaking changes!
